I need an html file that:
Uses bootstrap.
For any ajax calls, uses the function hotelAjax in /ajax/ajax.js.
Please note that the function takes two parameters: the path to the ajax file and an array of objects as parameters. Also, it returns a promise that resolves on the json data returned from the ajax call. Use .then syntax, NOT await!
Excepts the following parameters on the URL:
    hotel_id - the id of the hotel.
    room_id - (optional) the id of the room.
Calls ajax_get_hotel.php to get the details about the hotel.
Has a title at the top of the name of the hotel (from ajax_get_hotel.php).
Calls ajax_get_rooms.php to get a list of rooms for the hotel.
Has a strip across the top under the title with an image for each hotel room, listed horizontally. Use /show_image.php to get the images. The images should be thumbnails (150px wide). The number of images for the room should be overlaid over the top of each image.
If the room image matches the optional room_id parameter, it should have a bright border around it.
The room images should be clickable, with the url being the snip.html file, with the parameters being hotel_id and room_id.
